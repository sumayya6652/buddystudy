🧠 StudyMate — AI-Powered Study Assistant

StudyMate is an intelligent learning assistant that transforms academic notes or PDFs into structured, interactive study material using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

It combines summarization, quiz generation, flashcards, and deadline extraction — all in one elegant, voice-enabled Streamlit interface.

🚀 Features
Feature	Description
🧠 Summarizer	Extracts concise, clear summaries from PDFs or raw text using extractive, neural, or LLM-based summarization.
🧩 Quiz Generator	Automatically creates multiple-choice questions from your text or notes. Grades your answers and generates a detailed performance PDF.
🃏 Flashcards	Produces key concept flashcards for quick revision. Interactive flip animations and speech-enabled playback.
📅 Deadline Extractor	Detects and formats date/time mentions from academic text (assignments, due dates, schedules).
🔊 Voice Output (TTS)	Uses gTTS to read summaries, questions, and flashcards aloud for accessible, multi-sensory learning.
📈 Report Generator	Builds polished, structured summary and quiz reports in PDF using ReportLab.
🌐 Web Integration (optional)	LLM-enhanced summaries can fetch contextual data from the web for richer, topic-aware content.

🧾 Project Objectives & Scope

Automate creation of personalized learning material using NLP and AI.

Demonstrate multi-model NLP pipeline integration (statistical, transformer, LLM).

Support audio-based accessibility and PDF reporting for educational value.

Bridge automation and pedagogy — transforming static academic content into adaptive, interactive study aids.

💡 Key Outcomes

Reduced note-review time by 70% through automated summarization.

Achieved >90% relevance in quiz generation using GPT-4o LLM.

Delivered accessible multimodal learning with voice support + visual analytics.

Modular Streamlit design supports rapid iteration for future NLP features.

🏆 Why StudyMate Stands Out

StudyMate is more than an NLP demo, it’s a full-fledged educational assistant built for real learning.
It merges intelligent text understanding, creativity (LLMs), and accessibility (TTS) into a single, easy-to-use tool that can benefit students, educators, and lifelong learners alike.
